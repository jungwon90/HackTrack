### About the Engineer

Prior to attending Hackbright Academyâ€™s 12-week immersive full-stack software engineering program, Kelli held several roles in Accounting and Audit. Her curiosity, persistence, and analytical approach to problem solving made her highly effective as an Accountant but she struggled to feel fulfilled by the cyclical nature of the role. In 2018, she moved halfway across the country to take a job with Instacart in San Francisco. This shift to a growing technology start-up solidified her interest in Software Engineering and ultimately led her to pursue the Fellowship program at Hackbright. She is eager to use her platform to build impactful products and encourage other women to view this as an attainable and inclusive career path.
